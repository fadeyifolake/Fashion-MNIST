## Overview

In this project, I have developed a CNN model using Keras in both Python and R to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The assignment also includes making predictions for at least two images from the dataset.

## Tasks

### 1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

- Implemented a CNN with six layers using Keras and Python/R classes to classify the Fashion MNIST dataset.

### 2. Prediction

- Made predictions for at least two images from the Fashion MNIST dataset.

## Assignment Instructions

To successfully complete this assignment, follow these steps:

1. **Implement CNN**:
   - Develop a CNN model using Keras and Python/R classes with six layers to classify the Fashion MNIST dataset.

2. **Make Predictions**:
   - Use the trained model to make predictions for at least two images from the dataset.


## Usage

1. **Setup**: Ensure you have Python and R installed along with necessary libraries (Keras, TensorFlow, etc.).
2. **Clone Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. **Run Code**: Execute the Python/R scripts to train the CNN model and make predictions.
4. **Review Results**: Check the predictions made by the model for the Fashion MNIST images.
